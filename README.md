# custom_chatgpt_for_condo_rules
I train a chatbot to understand my building's rules so residents can quickly find out what they need to do to be in complience in various situations such as getting remodeling projects approved, using guest parking or moving furniture

This project is based on a tutorial by Baris Sen in https://textcortex.com/post/train-chatgpt-on-custom-data

Below are the package version I installed in my conda environment

```
gpt-index==0.4.24
gradio==3.24.1
langchain==0.0.118
openai==0.28.1
pypdf2==3.0.1
```

My first question for the custom chatbot concerns how you get a remodeling project approved in our building. The chatbot lists the necessary steps
